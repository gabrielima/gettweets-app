# Get Tweets - Mobile App

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Twitter Bootstrap, AngularJS, PHP & MySQL

This app retrieves your latest tweets and stores them on the server. It also allows the user to save passwords as notes, working as a reminder. The initial idea also consisted of retrieving all your text messages from your phone and store them on the server, however this feature was not implemented
